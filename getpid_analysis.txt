Fork Analysis for getpid_E.cpp
==============================

1. How many times was fork() executed?
   - Fork is executed 2 times in the program (inside the for loop).

2. How many processes and why?
   - The program starts with 1 process (the parent).
   - After the first fork, there are 2 processes (1 parent + 1 child).
   - After the second fork, each of the 2 processes forks again, resulting in 4 total processes.
   - Total processes = 4.

3. How many printf and why?
   - The printf statement is executed by each process every time the loop runs.
   - Initial: 1 printf for the parent.
   - After the first fork: 2 printf statements (1 for parent, 1 for child).
   - After the second fork: 4 printf statements (1 for each process).
   - Total printf calls = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
